# ADR-008: Model Context Protocol Integration

## Status
Draft

## Notes for Discussion

### Key Decision Points
- **MCP Implementation**: How to expose ToolVault tools via Model Context Protocol
- **AI Integration Depth**: Tool discovery vs full execution via AI
- **Security Boundaries**: What can AI systems do vs what requires human approval
- **Tool Composition**: How AI can chain tools together
- **Context Management**: How to maintain state across AI-driven tool sequences

### Important Aspects to Consider
1. **AI Use Cases**: What kinds of AI assistance are most valuable?
2. **Security Model**: How to prevent AI from accessing sensitive data?
3. **User Control**: When should AI require human confirmation?
4. **Error Handling**: How AI deals with tool failures
5. **Learning**: How AI improves tool selection over time
6. **Context Size**: Managing conversation context for complex analyses
7. **Tool Discovery**: How AI finds appropriate tools for user needs
8. **Result Validation**: How to verify AI-generated analyses

### Options to Evaluate
- Full MCP server exposing all tools
- Curated subset of AI-safe tools
- Read-only tool discovery vs full execution
- Human-in-the-loop for all AI actions
- Automated tool chaining with approval gates

### Business Requirements Impact
- User productivity gains from AI assistance
- Risk management for automated analysis
- Training requirements for AI-assisted workflows
- Competitive advantage in analytics capabilities
