# ADR-010: Tool Isolation and Security Model

## Status
Accepted

## Context
ToolVault hosts analysis tools for scientists and analysts in a bundle-based architecture where tools share dependencies for performance. The system is designed for operational efficiency rather than high-security environments. Future authentication requirements may focus on algorithm visibility and test data access control at the organizational level, but security threats are not a primary concern.

## Decision
We will implement a performance-oriented isolation model with the following characteristics:

### Execution Environment
- **Minimal isolation**: Tools run in shared Python process with namespace separation
- **Shared dependencies**: All tools in a vault share the same dependency versions
- **Process sharing**: Optimized for fast response times and resource efficiency
- **Future containerization**: Individual tool containers available when dependency conflicts arise

### Resource Management
- **No initial limits**: Monitor usage patterns before implementing constraints
- **Usage monitoring**: Track CPU, memory, and execution time for operational insights
- **Reactive controls**: Add resource limits only if operational problems emerge
- **Performance-first**: Avoid overhead from strict resource enforcement

### Input/Output Validation
- **Schema-based validation**: Ensure inputs match tool parameter schemas for correctness
- **Type checking**: Prevent runtime errors through basic type validation
- **Operational reliability**: Focus on preventing tool failures rather than security exploits
- **Tool author responsibility**: Trust tool creators for domain-specific input handling

### Authentication and Access Control
- **Initially open**: No authentication required for ToolVault access
- **Future vault-level auth**: Coarse-grained access control if organizational needs arise
- **Algorithm visibility**: Control which users can see specific tool collections
- **Test data protection**: Manage access to sensitive test datasets at vault level

### Dependency Conflict Resolution
- **Shared-first approach**: Default to shared dependencies within each vault
- **Containerization escape hatch**: Isolate individual tools when dependency conflicts emerge
- **Legacy tool support**: Maintain older tool versions through selective isolation
- **Performance preservation**: Keep fast shared execution as the primary model

## Rationale

### Performance Over Security
The operational focus prioritizes fast tool execution and resource efficiency over defense against malicious actors, reflecting the target environment and use cases.

### Shared Process Benefits
Running tools in shared processes provides immediate response times and efficient resource utilization, critical for interactive analytical workflows.

### Schema Validation Sufficiency
Validating inputs against tool schemas provides operational reliability without security overhead, preventing common runtime errors while maintaining performance.

### Reactive Resource Management
Monitoring usage before implementing limits allows the system to evolve based on actual usage patterns rather than theoretical constraints.

### Future-Proofed Authentication
Vault-level access control provides a simple path forward if organizational security requirements emerge.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Fast execution**: Shared processes provide optimal response times
- **Resource efficiency**: No isolation overhead in common cases
- **Simple architecture**: Minimal complexity for initial implementation
- **Flexible evolution**: Containerization available when needed
- **Operational focus**: Prevents tool failures without security complexity

### Negative
- **Limited security**: No protection against malicious tools or users
- **Dependency conflicts**: Shared dependencies may create version conflicts
- **Resource competition**: Tools can impact each other's performance
- **Future migration**: Adding strict isolation later may require architecture changes

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Usage monitoring**: Track resource consumption to identify problems early
- **Containerization readiness**: Maintain ability to isolate problematic tools
- **Schema enforcement**: Prevent most operational failures through input validation
- **Gradual hardening**: Add security measures only when/if requirements emerge

## Implementation Notes
- Tool execution framework will validate inputs against bundle schemas
- Resource monitoring will track CPU, memory, and execution time per tool
- Container isolation capability will be developed for dependency conflict scenarios
- Authentication framework will support vault-level access control when needed
- Shared dependency management will be optimized for common case performance
- Error handling will focus on operational recovery rather than security containment
