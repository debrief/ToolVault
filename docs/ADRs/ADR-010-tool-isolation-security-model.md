# ADR-010: Tool Isolation and Security Model

## Status
Draft

## Notes for Discussion

### Key Decision Points
- **Execution Environment**: Web Workers vs iframes vs other sandboxing
- **Tool Permissions**: What system resources tools can access
- **Input Validation**: How rigorously to validate tool inputs
- **Output Sanitization**: Preventing XSS and other output-based attacks
- **Bundle Verification**: How to ensure tool bundles haven't been tampered with

### Important Aspects to Consider
1. **Threat Model**: What attacks are we protecting against?
2. **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, storage quotas per tool
3. **Network Access**: Should tools be able to make external requests?
4. **File System**: Access to user's local files vs sandboxed storage
5. **Inter-tool Communication**: How tools share data securely
6. **Malicious Tools**: Preventing/detecting malicious tool behavior
7. **User Data Protection**: Ensuring user data doesn't leak
8. **Vulnerability Response**: How to handle discovered security issues

### Options to Evaluate
- Strict Web Worker isolation with no external access
- Graduated permissions model based on tool trust level
- Code signing and verification for all tools
- Runtime monitoring and anomaly detection
- User-controlled permission granting

### Business Requirements Impact
- User trust and adoption
- Regulatory compliance requirements
- Tool development complexity
- System administration overhead
