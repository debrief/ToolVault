# ADR-002: Browser-First Execution Model

## Status
Draft

## Notes for Discussion

### Key Decision Points
- **Execution Location**: Browser (Web Workers) vs server-side processing
- **Offline Capability**: Must work without internet connectivity after initial load
- **Performance Trade-offs**: Client-side compute vs server resources
- **Security Boundaries**: Tool isolation and sandboxing requirements
- **Data Processing Limits**: Browser memory constraints (100MB datasets specified)

### Important Aspects to Consider
1. **Tool Types**: What kinds of analytical tools need to run? CPU-intensive? Memory-heavy?
2. **Dataset Sizes**: How large are typical datasets? Peak sizes?
3. **Dependencies**: Can tools rely on external APIs or must everything be self-contained?
4. **User Environment**: What browser capabilities can we assume?
5. **Scalability**: How does browser execution scale vs server execution?
6. **Error Handling**: How to manage tool failures and resource exhaustion?
7. **Progress Reporting**: User feedback for long-running operations
8. **Cancellation**: Ability to stop/abort tool execution

### Options to Evaluate
- Pure browser execution with Web Workers
- Hybrid model (simple tools in browser, complex on server)
- Server-side execution with browser-based UI
- Progressive model (start browser, fallback to server)

### Business Requirements Impact
- Regulatory compliance and data residency
- IT infrastructure requirements
- User experience expectations
- Deployment complexity
