# ADR-005: Spatial Visualization with LeafletJS

## Status
Draft

## Notes for Discussion

### Key Decision Points
- **Mapping Library**: LeafletJS vs alternatives (OpenLayers, Mapbox GL JS, Google Maps)
- **Basemap Strategy**: Default tiles, offline support, customization
- **GeoJSON Support**: Native rendering vs conversion to other formats
- **Performance**: Large dataset handling, clustering, virtualization
- **Integration**: How maps integrate with tool execution pipeline

### Important Aspects to Consider
1. **Use Cases**: What kinds of spatial analysis will be visualized?
2. **Dataset Sizes**: How many points/polygons need to be rendered?
3. **Interactivity**: Selection, editing, measurement tools needed?
4. **Offline Requirements**: Maps must work without internet access?
5. **Customization**: Custom projections, specialized visualizations?
6. **Mobile Support**: Touch interactions, responsive design
7. **Accessibility**: Screen reader support for spatial data
8. **Export**: Ability to export maps as images/PDFs

### Options to Evaluate
- LeafletJS with plugin ecosystem
- OpenLayers for advanced GIS features
- Mapbox GL JS for performance and styling
- Custom WebGL-based solution
- Multiple libraries depending on use case

### Business Requirements Impact
- Spatial analysis workflow efficiency
- Training requirements for users
- License costs (if any)
- Integration with existing GIS systems
