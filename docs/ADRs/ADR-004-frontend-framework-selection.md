# ADR-004: Frontend Framework Selection

## Status
Draft

## Notes for Discussion

### Key Decision Points
- **Phase 1 Approach**: Framework-agnostic HTML/CSS/JS vs immediate framework adoption
- **Long-term Framework**: React, Vue, Svelte, or vanilla JS
- **TypeScript Adoption**: When to introduce TypeScript
- **Build System**: Webpack, Vite, Parcel, or no build step
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Support for JavaScript-disabled users

### Important Aspects to Consider
1. **Team Expertise**: What frameworks does the team know?
2. **Embedding Requirements**: How does framework choice affect embedding in other applications?
3. **Bundle Size**: Framework overhead vs feature requirements
4. **Performance**: SSR needs, hydration, runtime performance
5. **Ecosystem**: Component libraries, tooling, community support
6. **Migration Path**: How to evolve from Phase 1 to production framework?
7. **Maintenance**: Long-term support and update burden
8. **Accessibility**: Framework support for WCAG compliance

### Options to Evaluate
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS for all phases
- Start simple, migrate to React/TypeScript
- Immediate React/TypeScript adoption
- Modern vanilla JS with web components
- Lightweight alternatives (Preact, Svelte)

### Business Requirements Impact
- Development velocity
- Talent acquisition and training
- Integration complexity
- Long-term maintenance costs
