# ADR-009: Storage and Caching Strategy

## Status
Draft

## Notes for Discussion

### Key Decision Points
- **Browser Storage**: LocalStorage vs IndexedDB vs SessionStorage
- **What to Cache**: Tool results vs tool bundles vs execution history
- **Cache Invalidation**: How to handle tool updates and version changes
- **Storage Limits**: Browser storage quotas and management
- **History Preservation**: How long to keep execution history

### Important Aspects to Consider
1. **Data Types**: Different storage needs for different data types
2. **Offline Support**: What must be available offline vs online-only
3. **User Privacy**: Sensitive data handling and cleanup
4. **Performance Goals**: Cache hit rates and response times
5. **Storage Quotas**: Browser limits and user control
6. **Sync Across Devices**: Should data sync between user's devices?
7. **Export/Import**: User ability to backup/restore their data
8. **Cleanup Strategy**: Automatic cleanup vs user-managed storage

### Options to Evaluate
- No caching (always fresh, always online)
- Session-only caching (cleared on browser close)
- Persistent caching with TTL
- User-controlled caching with manual refresh
- Hybrid strategy (cache bundles, not results)

### Business Requirements Impact
- User experience with slow networks
- Data privacy and compliance requirements
- Storage costs and management complexity
- Offline work capability
