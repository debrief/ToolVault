# ADR-006: Backend Technology Stack

## Status
Draft

## Notes for Discussion

### Key Decision Points
- **Web Framework**: Flask vs FastAPI vs other Python frameworks
- **Jupyter Integration**: Embedded server vs external Jupyter instance
- **API Design**: REST vs GraphQL vs hybrid approach
- **Database**: Requirements for persistence, if any
- **Authentication**: How to handle user identity and authorization

### Important Aspects to Consider
1. **Performance Requirements**: Concurrent users, request/response times
2. **Jupyter Notebook**: How tightly integrated should notebooks be?
3. **Tool Execution**: Backend tool execution vs browser-only execution
4. **File Management**: Handling uploads, downloads, temporary files
5. **Scalability**: Single instance vs distributed deployment
6. **Development Experience**: Framework familiarity, debugging, testing
7. **Deployment**: Container support, cloud platform compatibility
8. **Security**: Input validation, sandboxing, rate limiting

### Options to Evaluate
- Flask with minimal features
- FastAPI with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- Django for full-featured development
- Node.js/Express for JavaScript consistency
- Go or Rust for performance-critical components

### Business Requirements Impact
- Development team productivity
- System administration complexity
- Integration with existing infrastructure
- Long-term maintenance burden
