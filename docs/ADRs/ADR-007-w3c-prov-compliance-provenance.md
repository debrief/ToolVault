# ADR-007: W3C PROV Compliance for Provenance

## Status
Draft

## Notes for Discussion

### Key Decision Points
- **PROV Standard Compliance**: Full W3C PROV-DM vs simplified provenance model
- **Embedding Strategy**: How provenance gets embedded in output files
- **Storage Format**: RDF, JSON-LD, or custom JSON schema
- **Granularity**: What level of detail to capture in provenance
- **Query Capability**: How users search and explore provenance data

### Important Aspects to Consider
1. **Regulatory Requirements**: What audit standards must be met?
2. **User Needs**: How will analysts actually use provenance information?
3. **Tool Impact**: How much overhead does provenance add to tool execution?
4. **Retroactive Analysis**: Finding all outputs affected by a tool defect
5. **Chain Complexity**: Handling multi-step pipeline provenance
6. **Export Formats**: Different provenance needs for different output types
7. **Privacy**: What information should/shouldn't be captured?
8. **Performance**: Impact on execution time and storage requirements

### Options to Evaluate
- Full W3C PROV-DM with RDF serialization
- Simplified JSON-based provenance model
- Hybrid approach with PROV-compatible subset
- External provenance service vs embedded provenance

### Business Requirements Impact
- Audit trail completeness and compliance
- Tool execution performance overhead
- Storage and bandwidth requirements
- User workflow complexity
