# ADR-012: Version Management Philosophy

## Status
Draft

## Notes for Discussion

### Key Decision Points
- **Versioning Scheme**: Semantic versioning vs date-based vs custom scheme
- **Execution Modes**: Original version vs latest version vs user choice
- **Version Storage**: How many versions to keep available
- **Comparison Tools**: Side-by-side result comparison capabilities
- **Update Notifications**: How users learn about tool updates

### Important Aspects to Consider
1. **Reproducibility**: Ensuring past analyses can be exactly reproduced
2. **Tool Evolution**: How to handle breaking changes in tools
3. **Storage Requirements**: Cost of keeping multiple tool versions
4. **User Workflow**: How users decide which version to use
5. **Deprecation**: How to sunset old tool versions
6. **Migration**: Helping users migrate to newer tool versions
7. **Compatibility**: Managing dependencies across tool versions
8. **Discovery**: How users find and understand version differences

### Options to Evaluate
- Pin everything to original versions for reproducibility
- Always use latest with optional override
- User-controlled version selection per tool
- Automatic migration with manual override
- Version recommendations based on analysis type

### Business Requirements Impact
- Analytical reproducibility and audit compliance
- Storage and maintenance costs
- User training and change management
- Quality assurance for version updates
