# ToolVault Phase Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the high-level phases for implementing ToolVault, emphasizing early feedback through mock JavaScript infrastructure before full backend development.

## Phase 1: Mock JavaScript Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
**Goal:** Rapidly prototype UI with functional JavaScript tools for immediate feedback

- Set up React/TypeScript SPA with Vite
- Implement metadata-driven UI from `index.json`
- Create tool discovery and browsing interface
- Build dynamic input forms and output renderers
- Integrate existing JavaScript mock tools
- Deploy to GitHub Pages for stakeholder review

## Phase 2: Enhanced UI & Tool Execution (Weeks 3-4)
**Goal:** Complete UI features with full mock tool functionality

- Add LeafletJS for spatial visualization
- Implement execution history tracking
- Create pipeline capture and replay
- Add provenance display (PROV format preview)
- Implement multi-format output viewers
- Enhance search with fuzzy matching


## Phase 3: Platform Integration (Weeks 9-10)
**Goal:** Enable multi-platform embedding

- Develop Debrief plugin adapter
- Create VS Code extension prototype
- Implement MCP (Model Context Protocol) support
- Add REST API documentation
- Create embedding examples
- Platform-specific testing

## Phase 4: Backend Infrastructure (Weeks 5-6)
**Goal:** Establish Python backend while maintaining JS mock tools

- Set up FastAPI backend structure
- Create REST API endpoints for tool discovery
- Implement dual runtime support (JS + Python)
- Add tool execution service layer
- Integrate with existing JavaScript tools
- Maintain GitHub Pages deployment

## Phase 5: Python Tool Integration (Weeks 7-8)
**Goal:** Transition to production tool execution

- Port key JavaScript tools to Python
- Implement Python tool execution engine
- Add Web Worker isolation for JS tools
- Create tool validation framework
- Implement error handling and recovery
- Performance optimization

## Phase 6: Production Readiness (Weeks 11-12)
**Goal:** Prepare for deployment and scaling

- Implement caching strategy
- Add audit trail functionality
- Complete WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Performance testing and optimization
- Security hardening
- Documentation and training materials

## Key Principles

1. **Early Feedback**: Deploy working UI with mock tools by end of Week 2
2. **Incremental Value**: Each phase delivers usable functionality
3. **Dual Runtime**: Support both JavaScript and Python tools throughout
4. **Metadata-Driven**: All UI generated from `index.json` specifications
5. **Platform Agnostic**: REST API design supports all integration targets

## Success Metrics

- Week 2: Stakeholders can browse and execute mock tools
- Week 4: Complete UI with pipeline functionality available
- Week 6: Backend supports both JS and Python execution
- Week 8: Production tools running with full provenance
- Week 10: Successfully embedded in at least one platform
- Week 12: Production-ready system meeting all requirements

## Risk Mitigation

- **Technical Risk**: Use proven technologies (React, FastAPI, LeafletJS)
- **Adoption Risk**: Early demos with mock tools to gather feedback
- **Integration Risk**: REST API approach simplifies platform integration
- **Performance Risk**: JavaScript mock tools validate UI performance early
