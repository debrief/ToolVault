# Memory Bank - Phase 3 Testing & Polish - Task 3.4 Error Handling

---
**Agent:** Agent_Frontend_Dev
**Task Reference:** Phase 3 / Task 3.4 - Error Handling and Loading States

**Summary:**
Implemented comprehensive error handling and user feedback systems with loading states, error boundaries, notification system, retry mechanisms, and graceful degradation throughout the ToolVault application.

**Details:**
- **Global Error Boundary System**: Created `ErrorBoundary` component with automatic error reporting, recovery mechanisms, and HOC wrapper. Includes `useErrorBoundary` hook for manual error triggering and support for reset keys and props change detection.
- **Error Display Components**: Built comprehensive `ErrorFallback` with different error type handling (network, chunk loading, generic), reload/navigation options, and development debug information. Created `NetworkError` components for various scenarios with auto-retry functionality.
- **Loading State System**: Implemented skeleton components (`ToolListSkeleton`, `ToolDetailSkeleton`) with configurable animation and content variants. Created `LoadingSpinner` with multiple variants (circular, linear, dots, pulse) and `ProgressLoader` for step-based operations.
- **Notification System**: Built `NotificationProvider` with MUI Snackbar integration, queue management, duplicate prevention, and transition animations. Includes helper hooks for error notifications.
- **Network Status Management**: Created `useNetworkStatus` hook with heartbeat monitoring, reconnection attempts, and connection quality assessment. Implemented `OfflineBanner` with automatic retry and connection status indicators.
- **Retry System**: Built `useRetry` hook with exponential backoff, jitter, circuit breaker pattern, and configurable retry conditions.
- **Enhanced Service Layer**: Extended error classes with comprehensive error types, retryability flags, and reporting utilities. Enhanced `toolVaultService` with timeout support, better error handling, and service method wrappers.
- **Validation Enhancement**: Improved input validation with sanitization, custom validators, warnings system, and comprehensive error codes.
- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Created resource management utilities including `AbortControllerManager`, `TimerManager`, `EventListenerManager`, and memory monitoring hooks with TTL cache implementation.
- **App Integration**: Updated `main.tsx` with error boundary hierarchy, provider setup, offline banner, and catastrophic failure fallback UI.

**Output/Result:**

```

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None - All error handling components and systems successfully implemented with comprehensive coverage.

**Next Steps:**
Error handling system is fully implemented and ready for testing. The application now has:
- Global error boundaries protecting against crashes
- User-friendly error displays with recovery options
- Comprehensive loading states for all major components
- Network status monitoring with offline support
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff and circuit breaking
- Memory leak prevention and resource management
- Enhanced service layer with robust error handling
- Form validation with detailed error reporting

The system provides graceful degradation and maintains application functionality even when errors occur, meeting all requirements specified in Task 3.4.
