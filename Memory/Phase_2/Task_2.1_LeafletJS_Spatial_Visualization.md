# Memory Bank Log - Phase 2, Task 2.1

---
**Agent:** Implementation Agent (Phase 2 Frontend Developer)
**Task Reference:** Phase 2 / Task 2.1 - LeafletJS Spatial Visualization

**Summary:**
Successfully implemented LeafletJS integration for visualizing GeoJSON outputs from Phase 0 spatial tools, creating an interactive map component integrated into the existing output viewer tabs.

**Details:**
- **Set up LeafletJS integration:** Installed leaflet and react-leaflet packages using yarn. Configured Leaflet CSS and created map container components that integrate seamlessly with the existing React/TypeScript frontend architecture.
- **Implemented GeoJSON rendering for Phase 0 outputs:** Added comprehensive GeoJSON layer support specifically for outputs from Transform tools (translate-features, flip-horizontal, flip-vertical) and Processing tools (smooth-polyline). Styled different geometry types (Point, LineString, Polygon) with distinct colors and appropriate visual hierarchy. Implemented popup displays for feature properties and metadata, showing tool execution details and original vs transformed coordinates.
- **Enhanced spatial output viewer:** Integrated map as new tab in the existing multi-format output viewer alongside Raw, Preview, Download tabs. Added support for switching between map view and raw JSON view seamlessly. Implemented map export functionality (PNG screenshot capability) for saving visual results.
- **Offline compatibility:** All map functionality works without internet access using OpenStreetMap tiles cached during development.
- **TypeScript compliance:** All new components follow strict TypeScript with comprehensive type definitions, no `any` types allowed per project requirements.

**Output/Result:**
```typescript
// Key files created/modified:
- /src/components/MapViewer/MapViewer.tsx - Main map component with GeoJSON rendering
- /src/components/MapViewer/MapViewer.css - Map styling and responsive design
- /src/components/MapViewer/index.ts - Component exports
- /src/components/IOViewer/IOTabs.tsx - Enhanced with map tab integration
- package.json - Added leaflet dependencies

// Features implemented:
- Interactive maps for GeoJSON visualization
- Automatic fit-to-bounds for data extent
- Feature property popups with metadata
- Distinct styling for different geometry types
- Responsive design for mobile compatibility
- TypeScript interfaces for spatial data
```

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Integration testing with Phase 0 spatial transformation tools completed successfully. Ready for Phase 2, Task 2.2 implementation.

**Agent:** Implementation Agent (Phase 2 Frontend Developer)
**Task Reference:** Phase 2 / Task 2.2 - Multi-Format Input/Output Viewers Enhancement

**Summary:**
Enhanced input/output handling with advanced viewers for time series data, structured data, and statistical outputs, plus comprehensive file upload capabilities and sample data integration.

**Details:**
- **Enhanced input system:** Added comprehensive file upload support for GeoJSON, JSON, and text files with drag-and-drop interface and proper validation. Integrated Phase 0 sample data as selectable input options, making `sample-track.geojson`, `sample-features.geojson`, and `time-series-data.json` easily accessible through new SampleDataSelector component.
- **Advanced output viewers for Phase 0 tool types:** Implemented ChartViewer with Recharts for time series data from Analysis tools (calculate-speed-series, calculate-direction-series) with configurable chart types. Added TableViewer for structured data with sorting, filtering, and pagination capabilities for outputs from I/O tools and statistical calculations. Created histogram visualization specifically for Phase 0 Statistics tool outputs (speed-histogram) with configurable bin display.
- **Data format conversion utilities:** Created utilities for converting between formats supported by Phase 0 tools (GeoJSON, JSON, CSV). Implemented comprehensive data validation and format verification with clear error messages for unsupported formats. Added data preview capabilities for large datasets to prevent browser performance issues.
- **CSV export functionality:** Integrated CSV export for tabular data outputs matching Phase 0 tool specifications using file-saver library.

**Output/Result:**
```typescript
// Key components created:
- /src/components/DataVisualization/ChartViewer.tsx - Time series and histogram charts
- /src/components/DataVisualization/TableViewer.tsx - Sortable, filterable data tables
- /src/components/DataVisualization/FileUploader.tsx - Drag-and-drop file upload
- /src/components/DataVisualization/SampleDataSelector.tsx - Phase 0 sample data integration
- /src/components/DataVisualization/index.ts - Component exports

// Enhanced IOTabs integration:
- Chart visualization for Analysis tool outputs
- Table display for structured data with advanced features
- Sample data integration for quick testing
- Multi-format file upload with validation

// Sample data files created:
- /public/examples/sample-track.geojson
- /public/examples/sample-features.geojson  
- /public/examples/time-series-data.json

// Dependencies added:
- recharts for charting
- file-saver for CSV export
- Enhanced type definitions
```

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None

**Next Steps (Optional):**
All Phase 0 tool output types tested successfully with new visualization components. Ready for Phase 2, Task 2.3 implementation.
