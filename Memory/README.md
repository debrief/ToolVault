# APM Project Memory Bank Directory

This directory houses the detailed log files for the ToolVault project.

## Structure:

Logs are organized into subdirectories corresponding to each Phase in the Implementation_Plan.md:
- `Phase_1_Project_Setup_Infrastructure/` - Setup and configuration logs
- `Phase_2_Core_UI_Implementation/` - UI development logs  
- `Phase_3_Testing_Polish/` - Testing and optimization logs

Within each phase directory, individual `.md` files capture logs for specific tasks.

All log entries within these files adhere to the format defined in `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md`.

For tasks involving architectural decisions, agents should reference relevant Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) from `docs/ADRs/` in their logs to provide context on established patterns and rationale.
