# APM Task Assignment: GitHub Pages Deployment

## 1. Task Assignment

**Reference Implementation Plan:** This assignment corresponds to `Phase 1, Task 1.6` in the [Implementation_Plan.md](../../Implementation_Plan.md).

**Objective:** Deploy the working application with Phase 0 tools for stakeholder review, creating a production-ready instance for testing and validation.

**Detailed Action Steps:**

1. **Configure deployment pipeline**
   - Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` GitHub Actions workflow:
     - Automated build triggers on main branch push and pull requests
     - Node.js setup with proper version specification (18.x or 20.x)
     - Install dependencies and run build process
     - Include Phase 0 bundle assets in build artifact
   - Configure Vite build for GitHub Pages deployment:
     - Set proper base path in `vite.config.ts` for GitHub Pages subdirectory
     - Ensure all Phase 0 JavaScript bundle files are included in build output
     - Configure asset handling for `examples/javascript-bundle/` integration
     - Optimize bundle size with code splitting and tree shaking
   - Handle client-side routing compatibility:
     - Create `404.html` fallback for React Router navigation
     - Configure proper redirect handling for SPA routing
     - Test routing works correctly in GitHub Pages environment

2. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**
   - Configure repository settings for GitHub Pages:
     - Enable GitHub Pages from GitHub Actions deployment source
     - Set custom domain if available or use default github.io subdomain
     - Configure HTTPS and security settings
   - Ensure Phase 0 JavaScript bundle accessibility:
     - Verify all tool scripts load correctly in production environment
     - Test dynamic script loading from `examples/javascript-bundle/tools/`
     - Confirm `index.json` metadata loading and parsing
     - Validate CORS settings for cross-origin resource loading
   - Create production deployment verification:
     - Test all 12 Phase 0 tools execute correctly in production
     - Verify tool parameter handling and output rendering
     - Test file upload/download functionality
     - Confirm responsive design works across devices

3. **Create deployment documentation and testing guides**
   - Create `docs/deployment.md` documentation:
     - Step-by-step deployment process including Phase 0 bundle integration
     - Troubleshooting guide for common deployment issues
     - Environment configuration and build optimization notes
     - Instructions for updating deployed version with new Phase 0 tools
   - Create `docs/stakeholder-testing-guide.md`:
     - User guide for stakeholder testing of Phase 0 tool functionality
     - Test scenarios covering all 5 tool categories (Transform, Analysis, Statistics, Processing, I/O)
     - Expected outputs and validation criteria for each tool type
     - Known limitations and future enhancement roadmap
   - Set up feedback collection mechanism:
     - Create GitHub issue templates for bug reports and feature requests
     - Add feedback link in application header/footer
     - Configure issue labels for different types of feedback (UI, tools, performance)
   - Prepare stakeholder demo script:
     - Highlight Phase 0 tool capabilities with specific examples
     - Demonstrate tool discovery, execution, and output rendering workflow
     - Show metadata-driven UI generation and dynamic form creation
     - Present tool execution with sample data and real-world scenarios

**Provide Necessary Context/Assets:**
- The deployment must include all Phase 0 JavaScript tools from `examples/javascript-bundle/`
- All 12 Phase 0 tools must be functional in the production environment
- Sample data files must be accessible for testing tool execution
- The application uses client-side routing which requires special GitHub Pages configuration
- Deployment should serve as validation environment for stakeholder feedback

## 2. Expected Output & Deliverables

**Define Success:** A fully functional ToolVault application deployed on GitHub Pages with all Phase 0 tools working correctly and comprehensive testing documentation.

**Specify Deliverables:**
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Automated deployment pipeline
- `vite.config.ts` - Production build configuration for GitHub Pages
- `404.html` - SPA routing fallback page
- `docs/deployment.md` - Comprehensive deployment documentation
- `docs/stakeholder-testing-guide.md` - User testing guide
- GitHub issue templates for feedback collection
- Working production deployment with all 12 Phase 0 tools functional
- Stakeholder demo script highlighting key capabilities
- Performance optimization and bundle size analysis

## 3. E2E Testing Requirements

Create comprehensive end-to-end tests to ensure the deployed service runs correctly:

1. **Service Availability Tests**
   - Verify application loads correctly at GitHub Pages URL
   - Test all routes and navigation functionality
   - Confirm asset loading (CSS, JS, images) without errors

2. **Phase 0 Tool Integration Tests**  
   - Test tool discovery and browsing for all 12 Phase 0 tools
   - Verify dynamic form generation for each tool's parameter schema
   - Execute each tool with sample data and validate outputs:
     - Transform tools: translate, flip-horizontal, flip-vertical
     - Analysis tools: speed-series, direction-series  
     - Statistics tools: average-speed, speed-histogram
     - Processing tools: smooth-polyline
     - I/O tools: import-rep, export-rep, export-csv
   - Test error handling and validation across all tools

3. **User Workflow Tests**
   - Complete user journey from tool discovery to execution
   - File upload and sample data selection functionality
   - Output viewing and download capabilities
   - Search and filtering across tool catalog
   - Responsive design validation on mobile and desktop

## 4. Memory Bank Logging Instructions

Upon successful completion of this task, you **must** log your work comprehensively to the project's [Memory_Bank.md](../../Memory_Bank.md) file. Adhere strictly to the established logging format. Ensure your log includes:
- A reference to Phase 1, Task 1.6 in the Implementation Plan
- A clear description of the deployment pipeline and configuration
- Production URL and deployment verification results
- Any challenges encountered with GitHub Pages or Phase 0 tool integration
- Confirmation of successful execution (all Phase 0 tools working in production with E2E test results)

## 5. Clarification Instruction

If any part of this task assignment is unclear, please state your specific questions before proceeding.
