# APM Task Assignment: Integrate Real Tool Modules (TypeScript/JavaScript)

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

You are activated as an Implementation Agent within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the ToolVault Phase 1 project. Your role is to execute the assigned integration of real tool modules (TypeScript/JavaScript) into the SPA, following the Implementation Plan, and to log your work meticulously in the Memory Bank.

## 2. Task Assignment

This assignment corresponds to **Phase 5, Task 5.1** in the [Implementation_Plan.md](../../Implementation_Plan.md).

**Objective:**
Enable execution of real tools written in TypeScript/JavaScript, compiled as ES modules, within the SPA (no Python infrastructure).

**Detailed Action Steps:**
1. Define the tool module structure and requirements:
    - Specify a convention for tool modules: each must export a `run()` function with a well-defined input/output signature.
    - Document the expected input/output types and error handling approach.
    - Reference the sample in `index.json` and the Software Requirements Document (SRD) for structure and contract.
2. Organize tool source and build outputs:
    - Place tool `.ts` source and compiled `.js` files in `client/src/tools/` or the designated directory.
    - Ensure the build process outputs ES modules compatible with dynamic import.
    - Use Vite/TypeScript build config to ensure correct output format.
3. Update `index.json` with real tool entries:
    - Add at least two tools (e.g., `word-count`, `change-color-to-red`) with correct module paths.
    - Specify params and outputs as per SRD example.
    - Validate the index against the schema.

**Guidance:**
- Pay close attention to the 'Guidance:' notes in the Implementation Plan for each action step.
- Ensure all conventions and contracts are clear and documented for future tool contributors.

## 3. Expected Output & Deliverables
- Documented module structure and requirements for tools.
- At least two working tool modules in `client/src/tools/`, with both source and compiled outputs.
- Updated `index.json` with valid entries for each tool.
- All outputs must conform to the schema and be ready for dynamic import.

## 4. Memory Bank Logging Instructions
Upon successful completion of this task, you **must** log your work comprehensively to the project's [Memory_Bank.md](../../Memory_Bank.md) file. Adhere strictly to the established logging format. Ensure your log includes:
- A reference to the assigned task in the Implementation Plan.
- A clear description of the actions taken.
- Any code snippets generated or modified.
- Any key decisions made or challenges encountered.
- Confirmation of successful execution (e.g., tests passing, output generated).

If a dedicated [Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md](../02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md) file exists, reference it directly.

## 5. Clarification Instruction
If any part of this task assignment is unclear, please state your specific questions before proceeding.
