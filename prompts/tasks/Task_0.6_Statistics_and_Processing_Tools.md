# APM Task Assignment: Statistics and Processing Tools Implementation

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

You are continuing as an Implementation Agent within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the ToolVault project, now focusing on completing the comprehensive tool suite with statistical analysis and data processing capabilities.

## 2. Onboarding / Context from Prior Work

**Prerequisites:** This task builds upon the completed work from:
- Task 0.1-0.3: Project structure and transform tools with comprehensive testing
- Task 0.4-0.5: Temporal analysis tools implemented and tested
- Established IIFE pattern and tool registration system from previous tasks

**Connection to Prior Work:** You will complete the JavaScript tool suite by implementing the remaining categories of tools: Statistics, Processing, and I/O. These tools will round out the functionality and provide comprehensive data analysis capabilities building on the foundation established in previous tasks.

## 3. Task Assignment

**Reference Implementation Plan:** This assignment corresponds to `Phase 0, Task 0.6 - Statistics and Processing Tools` in the [Implementation_Plan.md](../../Implementation_Plan.md).

**Objective:** Complete the tool suite with statistical analysis and data processing capabilities.

**Detailed Action Steps:**

1. **Implement Statistical tools:**
   - Create `tools/statistics/average-speed.js` for speed averaging with configurable time_unit support (seconds, minutes, hours)
   - Create `tools/statistics/speed-histogram.js` with configurable bins parameter and interval_minutes for time-based binning
   - Calculate comprehensive statistical measures: mean, median, standard deviation, min, max values
   - Return structured JSON outputs with statistical metadata including sample size, confidence intervals
   - Implement robust handling of outliers and edge cases in statistical calculations
   - Support weighted averages for non-uniform time intervals

2. **Implement Processing tools:**
   - Create `tools/processing/smooth-polyline.js` supporting multiple smoothing algorithms
   - Support algorithm parameter with options: "moving_average" and "gaussian" smoothing methods
   - Implement configurable window_size parameter for both smoothing approaches
   - Preserve LineString structure while smoothing coordinate sequences accurately
   - Maintain topology integrity and avoid creating self-intersections during smoothing
   - Handle edge effects at polyline endpoints appropriately

3. **Implement I/O tools:**
   - Create `tools/io/import-rep.js` for REP file format parsing (GPS track format)
   - Create `tools/io/export-rep.js` for REP format export with proper formatting
   - Create `tools/io/export-csv.js` for CSV export with multiple output options
   - Handle different encoding formats (UTF-8, ASCII) and coordinate precision settings
   - Support coordinate_format parameter for CSV: "separate" (lat,lon columns) or "wkt" (Well-Known Text)
   - Implement comprehensive error handling for file format validation and parsing

**Provide Necessary Context/Assets:**

- **REP Format Specification:** REP is a common GPS tracking format - research and implement proper parsing/export
- **Statistical Accuracy:** Use mathematically sound algorithms for statistical calculations, handle edge cases like empty datasets
- **Smoothing Algorithms:** Implement proper gaussian and moving average filters with appropriate kernel sizes
- **CSV Standards:** Follow RFC 4180 CSV specification with proper escaping and delimiter handling
- **IIFE Pattern:** Maintain consistency with tool registration pattern from previous tasks
- **Error Handling:** Provide comprehensive validation for all input parameters and data formats

## 4. Expected Output & Deliverables

**Define Success:** Successful completion means having a complete JavaScript tool suite with statistical analysis, data processing, and I/O capabilities that integrate seamlessly with previously implemented tools.

**Specify Deliverables:**
- `tools/statistics/average-speed.js` - Statistical averaging tool with time unit support
- `tools/statistics/speed-histogram.js` - Histogram generation tool with configurable binning
- `tools/processing/smooth-polyline.js` - Multi-algorithm polyline smoothing tool
- `tools/io/import-rep.js` - REP format import functionality
- `tools/io/export-rep.js` - REP format export functionality  
- `tools/io/export-csv.js` - Flexible CSV export with coordinate format options
- All tools properly registered using IIFE pattern in `window.ToolVault.tools`
- Comprehensive parameter validation and error handling
- Mathematical accuracy in statistical calculations and smoothing algorithms

**Format:** JavaScript files following established IIFE pattern with comprehensive input validation, statistical accuracy, and proper file format handling.

## 5. Memory Bank Logging Instructions

Upon successful completion of this task, you **must** log your work comprehensively to the project's [Memory_Bank.md](../../Memory_Bank.md) file.

Adhere strictly to the established logging format. Ensure your log includes:
- A reference to the assigned task in the Implementation Plan (Phase 0, Task 0.6)
- A clear description of statistical algorithms and smoothing methods implemented
- Code snippets showing key functionality for statistics, processing, and I/O operations
- REP file format parsing approach and validation strategy
- Statistical calculation methodologies and accuracy considerations
- Smoothing algorithm implementation details and topology preservation methods
- File format handling and encoding support decisions
- Any challenges encountered with mathematical precision or file format specifications
- Integration testing results with previously implemented tools
- Confirmation of successful execution (all tools working with proper I/O functionality)

## 6. Clarification Instruction

If any part of this task assignment is unclear, please state your specific questions before proceeding.
