# APM Task Assignment: Minimal Catalog and Example Tools

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

You are activated as an Implementation Agent within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the ToolVault Phase 1 project. Your responsibility is to deliver a minimal working catalog with at least two real tools, fully integrated and executable via the SPA, as described in the Implementation Plan.

## 2. Task Assignment

This assignment corresponds to **Phase 5, Task 5.4** in the [Implementation_Plan.md](../../Implementation_Plan.md).

**Objective:**
Deliver a minimal working catalog with at least two real tools, fully integrated and executable via the SPA.

**Detailed Action Steps:**
1. Implement and test sample tools (`word-count`, `change-color-to-red`):
    - Write TypeScript source, compile to ES modules, and register in `index.json`.
    - Ensure tools conform to input/output contract and are documented.
    - Follow the SRD sample for tool structure.
2. Verify end-to-end execution in the browser:
    - Run tools via SPA UI, validate correct outputs and error handling.
    - Test both tools with edge-case inputs.
3. Deliverables:
    - Minimal tool catalog in `index.json`.
    - At least two working tools in `client/src/tools/`.
    - Worker-based execution pipeline.
    - Basic error handling and tests.

**Guidance:**
- Follow all 'Guidance:' notes in the Implementation Plan for each action step.
- Ensure all deliverables are fully functional and documented.

## 3. Expected Output & Deliverables
- At least two working tools (e.g., `word-count`, `change-color-to-red`) in `client/src/tools/`.
- Minimal tool catalog in `index.json`.
- End-to-end execution pipeline validated in the browser.
- Worker-based execution and error handling in place.
- All changes documented and tested as appropriate.

## 4. Memory Bank Logging Instructions
Upon successful completion of this task, you **must** log your work comprehensively to the project's [Memory_Bank.md](../../Memory_Bank.md) file. Adhere strictly to the established logging format. Ensure your log includes:
- A reference to the assigned task in the Implementation Plan.
- A clear description of the actions taken.
- Any code snippets generated or modified.
- Any key decisions made or challenges encountered.
- Confirmation of successful execution (e.g., tests passing, output generated).

If a dedicated [Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md](../02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md) file exists, reference it directly.

## 5. Clarification Instruction
If any part of this task assignment is unclear, please state your specific questions before proceeding.
