# APM Task Assignment: Dynamic Tool Loading and Execution Pipeline

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

You are activated as an Implementation Agent within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the ToolVault Phase 1 project. Your responsibility is to implement the dynamic tool loading and execution pipeline for real tool modules, ensuring robust input validation and output rendering in the SPA.

## 2. Task Assignment

This assignment corresponds to **Phase 5, Task 5.2** in the [Implementation_Plan.md](../../Implementation_Plan.md).

**Objective:**
Implement dynamic loading and execution of tool modules via `import()`, with input validation and output rendering.

**Detailed Action Steps:**
1. Implement dynamic import of tool modules:
    - Use `import()` to load the module specified in `index.json` at runtime.
    - Handle loading errors and provide graceful fallbacks in the UI.
    - Ensure compatibility with the Vite/SPA build pipeline.
2. Validate tool inputs and outputs:
    - Validate input parameters against type definitions in `index.json` before execution.
    - Validate outputs after execution; display an error if the contract is violated.
    - Use TypeScript types and runtime checks for validation.
3. Invoke `run()` in a Web Worker:
    - Offload execution to a Web Worker to avoid blocking the UI.
    - Pass validated inputs to the worker and handle outputs/messages from the worker.
    - Handle worker errors and timeouts appropriately.
    - Use transferable objects for performance if possible.
4. Render outputs in the UI:
    - Display results using the existing output rendering pipeline (tables, maps, etc.).
    - Show execution progress and errors.
    - Reuse or extend UI components from previous phases as needed.

**Guidance:**
- Carefully follow the 'Guidance:' notes in the Implementation Plan for each step.
- Ensure robust error handling and clear user/developer feedback.

## 3. Expected Output & Deliverables
- Dynamic tool loading and execution pipeline implemented in the SPA.
- Input and output validation logic integrated with the UI.
- Web Worker-based execution for tools.
- Output rendering integrated with the pipeline.
- All changes documented and tested as appropriate.

## 4. Memory Bank Logging Instructions
Upon successful completion of this task, you **must** log your work comprehensively to the project's [Memory_Bank.md](../../Memory_Bank.md) file. Adhere strictly to the established logging format. Ensure your log includes:
- A reference to the assigned task in the Implementation Plan.
- A clear description of the actions taken.
- Any code snippets generated or modified.
- Any key decisions made or challenges encountered.
- Confirmation of successful execution (e.g., tests passing, output generated).

If a dedicated [Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md](../02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md) file exists, reference it directly.

## 5. Clarification Instruction
If any part of this task assignment is unclear, please state your specific questions before proceeding.
