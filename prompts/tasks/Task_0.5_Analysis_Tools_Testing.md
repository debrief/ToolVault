# APM Task Assignment: Analysis Tools Unit Testing

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

You are continuing as a Test Specialist Implementation Agent within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the ToolVault project. Your specialized focus is now on validating temporal analysis tools with mathematical precision and comprehensive edge case coverage.

## 2. Onboarding / Context from Prior Work

**Prerequisites:** This task builds upon the completed work from:
- Task 0.1-0.3: Project structure, transform tools, and testing framework established
- Task 0.4: Temporal analysis tools implemented (`speed-series.js`, `direction-series.js`) with timestamp parsing and time series generation

**Connection to Prior Work:** You will create comprehensive unit tests for the temporal analysis tools implemented in Task 0.4, validating mathematical accuracy against known reference data, timestamp processing reliability, and time series output correctness.

## 3. Task Assignment

**Reference Implementation Plan:** This assignment corresponds to `Phase 0, Task 0.5 - Analysis Tools Unit Testing` in the [Implementation_Plan.md](../../Implementation_Plan.md).

**Objective:** Verify temporal calculations against known reference data with comprehensive test coverage.

**Detailed Action Steps:**

1. **Test Speed Series calculations:**
   - Create test file `tests/analysis/speed-series.test.js`
   - Create reference GPS track data with mathematically verified speeds for validation
   - Test with different time units (seconds, minutes, hours) and verify unit conversion accuracy
   - Verify speed calculations using haversine formula against independent reference implementations
   - Test edge cases: stationary points (zero speed), high-speed segments, irregular time gaps, missing timestamps
   - Validate time series output format and metadata structure
   - Test timestamp format handling (ISO 8601, Unix epoch, mixed formats)

2. **Test Direction Series calculations:**
   - Create test file `tests/analysis/direction-series.test.js`
   - Validate bearing calculations with known coordinate pairs and expected compass bearings
   - Test smoothing algorithms with synthetic data having known smoothing effects
   - Verify direction continuity and proper angle normalization (0-360°)
   - Test with different window_size values and validate smoothing behavior mathematically
   - Test edge cases: 180° bearing crossings, single point inputs, zero-distance segments
   - Validate output format consistency with timestamp/direction pairs

3. **Temporal data validation testing:**
   - Create test file `tests/analysis/temporal-validation.test.js`
   - Test with various timestamp formats including timezone variations
   - Verify comprehensive error handling for missing, invalid, or inconsistent timestamps
   - Test performance with large datasets (1000+ GPS points with timestamps)
   - Validate memory usage patterns and execution time constraints
   - Test with malformed temporal data and ensure graceful error handling
   - Verify handling of out-of-order timestamps and duplicate time entries

**Provide Necessary Context/Assets:**

- **Mathematical Validation:** Create reference datasets with independently calculated speed and bearing values
- **Performance Requirements:** Test with realistic GPS track sizes typical for mobile applications
- **Timestamp Precision:** Test various timestamp precisions (second, millisecond, microsecond)
- **Coverage Target:** Maintain 100% code coverage goal established in previous testing tasks
- **Error Scenarios:** Test comprehensive error conditions for robust temporal data handling

## 4. Expected Output & Deliverables

**Define Success:** Successful completion means comprehensive test coverage for temporal analysis tools with mathematically validated accuracy, robust timestamp handling, and performance benchmarks meeting requirements.

**Specify Deliverables:**
- `tests/analysis/speed-series.test.js` - Complete test suite for speed calculations
- `tests/analysis/direction-series.test.js` - Complete test suite for direction/bearing calculations  
- `tests/analysis/temporal-validation.test.js` - Temporal data validation and error handling tests
- Mathematical reference data fixtures for validation
- Performance benchmark results for large dataset processing
- Test coverage report maintaining 100% coverage for analysis tools
- Error handling validation covering all temporal edge cases
- All tests passing with mathematical accuracy verified

**Format:** Jest test files with comprehensive mathematical validation, performance benchmarks, and detailed assertions for temporal data processing accuracy.
