# APM Task Assignment: Multi-Format Input and Output Viewers Enhancement

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

You are activated as an Implementation Agent within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the ToolVault project. Your role is to execute assigned tasks diligently while maintaining comprehensive documentation of all work performed. You will work with the Manager Agent (via the User) and must log all activities to the Memory Bank for project continuity.

## 2. Task Assignment

**Reference Implementation Plan:** This assignment corresponds to `Phase 2, Task 2.2` in the [Implementation_Plan.md](../../Implementation_Plan.md).

**Objective:** Enhance input/output handling to support diverse Phase 0 tool formats, creating advanced viewers for time series data, structured data, and statistical outputs while improving the input system with file upload capabilities.

**Detailed Action Steps:**

1. **Enhanced input system:**
   - Add file upload support for GeoJSON, JSON, and text files that Phase 0 tools can process
   - Integrate Phase 0 sample data as selectable input options - make `sample-track.geojson`, `sample-features.geojson`, and other test data from `/examples/javascript-bundle/data/` easily accessible
   - Implement drag-and-drop file interface with proper file validation and user feedback
   - Create input validation for different file formats used by Phase 0 tools, including GeoJSON structure validation and coordinate system verification

2. **Advanced output viewers for Phase 0 tool types:**
   - Implement chart visualization for time series data from Analysis tools (calculate-speed-series, calculate-direction-series) - use appropriate charting library that integrates well with React
   - Add table viewer for structured data with sorting and filtering capabilities for outputs from I/O tools and statistical calculations
   - Create histogram visualization specifically for Phase 0 Statistics tool outputs (speed-histogram) with configurable bin display
   - Support CSV export for tabular data outputs from I/O tools (export-csv) - ensure the export matches the tool's native output format

3. **Data format conversion utilities:**
   - Create utilities for converting between formats supported by Phase 0 tools (GeoJSON, JSON, CSV, REP)
   - Implement data validation and format verification with clear error messages for unsupported formats
   - Add data preview capabilities for large datasets to prevent browser performance issues
   - Create format-specific error handling and user feedback with actionable guidance

**Provide Necessary Context/Assets:**

- The existing frontend architecture is in `/toolvault-frontend/` with services in `src/services/`
- Current tool execution system is in `src/services/toolService.ts` - extend this for enhanced I/O
- Phase 0 tools return different output formats: JSON time series (Analysis), statistical objects (Statistics), GeoJSON (Transform/Processing), and file content (I/O)
- Sample data location: `/examples/javascript-bundle/data/` contains test files for all tool categories
- The project uses TypeScript strict mode with comprehensive type checking required
- **Reference ADR-001:** Review metadata-driven architecture principles for UI generation
- Existing output viewer in the frontend uses a tabbed interface that should be extended

**Constraints:**
- All file handling must work offline without external dependencies
- Maintain compatibility with existing Phase 0 tool execution flow
- Follow existing TypeScript interfaces and component architecture patterns
- Ensure accessibility standards for file upload and data visualization components
- Performance optimization required for large dataset handling (1000+ data points)

## 3. Expected Output & Deliverables

**Define Success:** Successful completion requires:
- File upload system working with drag-and-drop for all Phase 0 supported formats
- Chart visualization displaying time series outputs from Analysis tools correctly
- Table viewer handling structured data with sorting/filtering
- Histogram visualization working with Statistics tool outputs
- CSV export functionality matching Phase 0 tool specifications
- Data format conversion utilities working between supported formats
- All components integrated into existing output viewer architecture

**Specify Deliverables:**
- Enhanced input components with file upload and Phase 0 sample data integration
- New visualization components: charts for time series, tables for structured data, histograms for statistics
- Data format conversion utilities with validation
- Updated output viewer supporting new visualization types
- TypeScript interfaces for new data formats and viewer configurations
- CSV export functionality integrated with I/O tool outputs

## 4. Memory Bank Logging Instructions

Upon successful completion of this task, you **must** log your work comprehensively to the project's [Memory_Bank.md](../../Memory_Bank.md) file.

Adhere strictly to the established logging format. Ensure your log includes:
- A reference to Phase 2, Task 2.2 in the Implementation Plan
- A clear description of input/output enhancements implemented
- Any code snippets for key visualization components created
- Any key decisions made regarding charting libraries or data handling approaches
- Confirmation of successful execution with all Phase 0 tool output types tested
- Any challenges encountered with large dataset handling or format conversion

## 5. Clarification Instruction

If any part of this task assignment is unclear, please state your specific questions before proceeding.
