# APM Task Assignment: Error Handling and Developer Experience for Tool Integration

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

You are activated as an Implementation Agent within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the ToolVault Phase 1 project. Your responsibility is to implement robust error handling and developer experience improvements for the tool integration and execution pipeline, as described in the Implementation Plan.

## 2. Task Assignment

This assignment corresponds to **Phase 5, Task 5.3** in the [Implementation_Plan.md](../../Implementation_Plan.md).

**Objective:**
Provide robust error handling, developer feedback, and maintainability for tool integration and execution.

**Detailed Action Steps:**
1. Implement user-friendly error reporting for tool execution failures:
    - Display clear error messages for module load errors, validation failures, and runtime exceptions.
    - Provide developer diagnostics in development mode.
    - Ensure errors are actionable for both users and developers.
2. Document the tool integration process:
    - Create a developer guide for adding new tools (structure, build, registration in `index.json`).
    - Include troubleshooting tips for common issues (e.g., module not found, type mismatch).
    - Update project docs in `client/docs/` as needed.
3. Add basic test cases for the tool execution pipeline:
    - Write unit tests for dynamic import, validation, and worker communication.
    - Ensure at least one test per tool type (e.g., GeoJSON, string processing).
    - Use Jest/RTL for UI, and worker test utilities as appropriate.

**Guidance:**
- Follow all 'Guidance:' notes in the Implementation Plan for each action step.
- Ensure documentation is clear and actionable for future contributors.

## 3. Expected Output & Deliverables
- User-facing and developer-facing error handling for tool execution pipeline.
- Developer guide for tool integration and troubleshooting.
- Basic unit tests for pipeline and tool types.
- All changes documented and tested as appropriate.

## 4. Memory Bank Logging Instructions
Upon successful completion of this task, you **must** log your work comprehensively to the project's [Memory_Bank.md](../../Memory_Bank.md) file. Adhere strictly to the established logging format. Ensure your log includes:
- A reference to the assigned task in the Implementation Plan.
- A clear description of the actions taken.
- Any code snippets generated or modified.
- Any key decisions made or challenges encountered.
- Confirmation of successful execution (e.g., tests passing, output generated).

If a dedicated [Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md](../02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md) file exists, reference it directly.

## 5. Clarification Instruction
If any part of this task assignment is unclear, please state your specific questions before proceeding.
